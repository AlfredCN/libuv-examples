libuv examples

Each script here is a small example of how to use libuv. Each of these
were compiled against libuv v0.11.22.

The Makefile is pretty shabby, but it has a few basics. First, to build
libuv just run:

$ make libuv.a

Then you can run make against any given target file by doing:

$ BUILDFILE=<filename> make

This will compile the file to ./run. You can also specify the name of
the output file like so:

$ OUTFILE=<filename> make

That about covers it. If you see any issues/improvements PRs are more
than welcome.
